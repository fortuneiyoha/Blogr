## My process

### Technology used

This project was built using the following frontend technologies and methodologies:

- **Semantic HTML5 markup:** To provide a clear and meaningful structure to the content.
- **CSS custom properties:** To efficiently manage and reuse style values throughout the project.
- **CSS Grid:** To create powerful and flexible layouts with precise control over placement and alignment.
- **Flexbox:** To create flexible and responsive layouts.
- **JavaScript:** To add interactivity and dynamic functionality to the project.
- **Sass:** To write CSS more efficiently with nested rules, variables, and mixins.
- **Hyphen Delimiter:** Incorporated to enhance the visual presentation and organization of elements, contributing to a more polished and user-friendly design.
- **Mobile-first workflow:** To ensure a better user experience on smaller screens and devices.

### Useful resources

- [MDN: isolation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/isolation): This article helped me grasp the concept of maintaining stacking order for elements.
- [MDN: Stacking context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_positioned_layout/Understanding_z-index/Stacking_context): This article clarified how elements interact with each other using the `z-index` property, making it easier to control their visual arrangement.
